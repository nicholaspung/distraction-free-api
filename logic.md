# Logic

## Save titles to db

- Get titles from reddit
- Insert titles into db, if titles is already in db, do nothing

## Get posts from db

- Join users/titles/posts and query from db where read boolean equal to false

## Update seen posts

- Update seen post to have read boolean equal to true

## Auto delete posts after every 15 days

- Posts must have a created_at field
